The Gift of Giving

This app allows users to create, share, and expand personal gift registries for any occasion.  If you're looking for a registry that's unique, stylish, and simple to use, then The Gift of Giving is just for you. 

Upon loading our app, the user will be taken to a landing page that prompts them to create an account, or login if they've already done so.  The Gift of Giving utilizes both the Facebook and Google APIs to allow users to login in with their respective accounts, or to authorize their login account with just their email.  The use of these marketing tools will help the user to share their registries far and wide with their families and friends.

After logging in, the user is then taken to a Home Page where they can build and view their own personal registries, as well as registries that have been shared with them by others.  Items on each registry will be listed on individual cards, which will entail three things: (1) an item name, (2) a link to a website promoting the item, and (3) a field that describes the said item.  

Item cards will also be editable by their creator, and the lists themselves can be added to or subtracted from as well after their initial creations.  Once the items are purchased by others, the cards will be blanked out as a notification to others that the item has already been purchased.


Technologies Implemented

The architecture of our app utilizes React on the front-end, creating a simple and splendid user experience.  Google's and Facebook's APIs stretch the collaborative boundaries even further, and will certainly act as useful additions, should the user choose to use these features.  

All registries and user authentication information will be stored on Firebase, a cloud-based technology that simplifies our architecture even further, and is perfectly reliable for deploying smaller applications such as The Gift of Giving.    



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
